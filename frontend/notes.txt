Fix bug on home page if user cancels connection with wallet.

Spamming or abuse	
Someone could join, pay 10 tHYDRA, then call many transactions and drain the gas pool. 
Solution: track per-player usage, limit txs, or expire access.

Trust model
Players are trusting that this 10 tHYDRA isn't refundable and will only be used to fuel
their game actions.This should be clearly explained in UI.
